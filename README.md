* We had a long weekend so I made this dragon game from freecodecamp. Felt pretty cool. It was tedious, giving everything functionality, one button having many many things. It was fun though. Try playing it here: [dragon game](https://karegapauline.github.io/Projects/javascript_learn/dragon_game_freecodecamp/index.html). I'll personalize it at some point, or find another game prompt to try develop. Was I doing this to avoid PhD tasks over the weekend, absolutely. And if I'm being totally honest, part of last week also. It's a weird game, not the best, but hey, I started, I finished, and I understood concepts.

Health and Environment Research (Figuring this out fast and slow). 

# Projects
Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya initiative mainly. And other two are called MaterDB, and KatikaNaMe.

PS: Imposter Syndrome and Fear are tiny little joy stealers, happiness suckers, and just plain old stupid.
