# Things I work on
Programming, Work, Projects, and other things 

# Programming 
- Python

*pythonproj1: The cipher. No, I am not avoiding PhD tasks, I am trying to build a routine and finish what I start. I enjoyed this project. I did the tasks at a specific time each day. It's a cipher, an encrypter, and a decrypter, where you give a certain text as a key. The encrypter was easy to understand, and the decrypted was a bit of a challenge.
[The cipher](https://karegapauline.github.io/Projects/pyth/cipher.py): Try it out. Hmmm, well, you can't really because it doesn't accept user input. Give me some time, I'll fix that.*

*pythonproj2: The card number verifier. Now this one I had a lot of fun. Probably because I took time to write the pseudocode and understand the project. It uses the luhn algorithm to validate identification numbers. [Card number verifier](https://karegapauline.github.io/Projects/pyth/luhnalg.py): Again, it doesn't accept user input so you can't test it out nicely just yet. Give me some time, I'll fix that.*


- SQL
- JavaScript in folder javascript_learn

*jsproj1: We had a long weekend so I made this dragon game from freecodecamp. Felt pretty cool. It was tedious, giving everything functionality, one button having many many things. It was fun though. Try playing it here: [dragon game](https://karegapauline.github.io/Projects/javascript_learn/dragon_game_freecodecamp/index.html). I'll personalize it at some point, or find another game prompt to try develop. Was I doing this to avoid PhD tasks over the weekend, absolutely. And if I'm being totally honest, part of last week also. It's a weird game, not the best, but hey, I started, I finished, and I understood concepts.*   

# Work
Health and Environment Research (Figuring this out fast and slow). 

# Projects
Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya initiative mainly. And other two are called MaterDB, and KatikaNaMe.

PS: Imposter Syndrome and Fear are tiny little joy stealers, happiness suckers, and just plain old stupid. 
Another PS: there is a method to the madness, in terms of the learning style. I am trying to build solid confidence. I know the basics of the 3 languages above. I am testing those foundations with weekly projects. I go back and forth in the basics and application of those until they all sink in. Also, if there's a difference between developers and data scientists, I am not sure what exactly I want if I'm being honest.
