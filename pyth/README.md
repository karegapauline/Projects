#Python projects
1. pythonproj1: The cipher. No, I am not avoiding PhD tasks, I am trying to build a routine and finish what I start. I enjoyed this project. I did the tasks at a specific time each day. It's a cipher, an encrypter, and a decrypter, where you give a certain text as a key. The encrypter was easy to understand, and the decrypted was a bit of a challenge. The cipher: Try it out. Hmmm, well, you can't really because it doesn't accept user input. Give me some time, I'll fix that.

3. pythonproj2: The card number verifier. Now this one I had a lot of fun. Probably because I took time to write the pseudocode and understand the project. It uses the luhn algorithm to validate identification numbers. Card number verifier: Again, it doesn't accept user input so you can't test it out nicely just yet. Give me some time, I'll fix that.
